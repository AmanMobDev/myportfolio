          "Implemented the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture in an academic project to separate UI from business logic. MVVM organizes code into three layers:\n● Model: Manages data and business logic\n● View: Displays UI and binds to the ViewModel\n● ViewModel: Handles data transformation and provides data to the pages This design improves app maintainability, scalability, and testability, while promoting clean code and better separation of concerns.",
